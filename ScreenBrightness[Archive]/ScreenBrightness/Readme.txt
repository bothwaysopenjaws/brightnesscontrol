A tool for dispaying screen brightness on laptops (err specially sony err.. :D)
Tested on win7 (x86) and win8(x64)
Needs Microsoft .net framework 4 (and might not compile properly on lower versions)
Only works on laptops and not pcs...
This is a freeware software

Credits to stepe (Code Project) http://www.codeproject.com/Members/stepe , I actually worked a little on his project ,although this project can be improved furthur
if the application starts without issues , the app icon will show up in the taskbar info area
right-clicking will show an exit button to close the app
the program will only show up on changing of the value of your screen brightness ,though there is a slider in the code , i have removed it from runtime
for any information or queries , contact me on my email id puranjay.jain@live.com
* also if you want the application to run on startup just open the windows explorer and type in %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup and paste the shortcut of my application there.
thank you
